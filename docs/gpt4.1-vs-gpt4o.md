# GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4o: Agents, CoT, and Context

* **Date**: 16.07.25
* **Note**: Information in this article is summarized by GPT-4o

---

Here’s a detailed comparison between **GPT‑4o** and **GPT‑4.1**, focusing on context window, tool/CoT support, and agent capabilities:

---

### 🧠 1. Context Window & Long-Context Handling

* **GPT‑4o** supports up to **128 K tokens**, suitable for long conversations and multimodal input (text+audio+vision) ([OpenAI][1]).
* **GPT‑4.1** expands this massively to a **1 million token** context window—8× larger than GPT‑4o—designed to reliably “attend to information across the full 1 M context length” ([The Verge][2]).

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPT‑4.1 is ideal for agents handling vast inputs (entire codebases, legal documents) without losing context.

---

### 🔧 2. Tools & Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) / Agent Capabilities

* GPT‑4.1 was **specifically trained** to generate coherent **code diffs**, maintain tool usage consistently, and reduce extraneous edits, showing twice the reliability over GPT‑4o in diff-style tasks ([OpenAI][3]).
* On benchmarks like SWE‑Bench Verified, GPT‑4.1 scores \~**54.6%**, compared to GPT‑4o’s \~33.2%—a **21 pt absolute gain** in real-world code generation & multi-step logic ([Medium][4]).
* Independent testers report: **60% fewer errors** or **30–60% higher efficiency** on tool-based tasks and agentic code workflows ([OpenAI][3]).

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPT‑4.1 offers much stronger **Chain-of-Thought coherence** and **tool/agent integration**, making it far more capable at stepwise reasoning and orchestration.

---

### 💸 3. Cost & Latency

* **GPT‑4o** is **fast and cheap**, but
* **GPT‑4.1** is about **26% cheaper** per million tokens, while also being **faster and more efficient** ([The Verge][2]).

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPT‑4.1 manages to exceed GPT‑4o’s performance **while reducing cost and latency**.

---

### 🎯 4. Multimodality & Knowledge Cutoff

* **GPT‑4o** is a true “omni” model: native support for **text, image, audio, video**, real-time voice interaction, and multilingual capabilities across \~50+ languages, with **low latency (\~320 ms)** ([Wikipedia][5]).
* **GPT‑4.1**, in contrast, is **API-only**, text (and image) oriented—no direct voice or multimodal output in ChatGPT. Its knowledge cutoff is **June 2024**, slightly newer than GPT‑4o’s **October 2023** .

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPT‑4o remains the go-to for **multimodal, real-time interactions**, while GPT‑4.1 excels for **precision text/code agents**.

### 🧩 5. Summary Table

| Feature                      | GPT‑4o                         | GPT‑4.1                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Context window**           | 128 K tokens                   | 1 M tokens                           |
| **Coding/agent performance** | Baseline                       | +21 pt SWE-Bench, better diffs & CoT |
| **Tool integration**         | Good                           | Stronger, more reliable              |
| **Multimodality**            | Text/vision/audio/video native | Text + image only                    |
| **Latency & Cost**           | Fast, moderately priced        | 26% cheaper, faster                  |
| **Availability**             | ChatGPT + API                  | API-only                             |

### ✅ In summary

For your focus — **large-context reasoning**, **Chain-of-Thought**, and **tool/agent workflows** — **GPT‑4.1** is a clear upgrade:

* **1M token window** keeps agents coherent over extensive tasks.
* Trained for **structured reasoning**, coherent diffs, and tool calls.
* **Cheaper and faster** than GPT‑4o.

However, if your agents require **audio/vision inputs** and **real-time multimodal interaction**, **GPT‑4o** remains unmatched.
